## Comparing Regression Algorithms with SKLearn
This project aims to compare various regression algorithms using the Scikit-Learn library. It includes implementations and evaluations of multiple regression models to understand their performance on this [datasets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ml-learning-path-assets/master/data/predict_home_value.csv). The models compared in this project are:

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression

## Features
- Simple Linear Regression: A basic linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable.
- Multiple Linear Regression: Extends simple linear regression to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
- Polynomial Linear Regression: Fits a polynomial equation to the data, allowing for a non-linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
- Decision Tree Regression: A non-parametric model that splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like structure.
- Random Forest Regression: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges their results to improve accuracy and control over-fitting.
